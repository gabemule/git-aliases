## Needed Improvements for Feature Parity

### update-branch Improvements

#### 1. Remote Sync Support
Adds the ability to synchronize with remote branches, matching sync's capabilities.

##### Description
- Handles remote branch divergence
- Supports rebase workflow
- Includes push capability
- Preserves local changes

##### Implementation
```bash
# Add to update-branch implementation
# After main branch merge
echo "Syncing with remote..."
if ! git pull origin $current_branch --ff-only; then
    echo "Branch has diverged from remote. Attempting rebase..."
    if ! git pull --rebase origin $current_branch; then
        handle_rebase_conflicts
    fi
fi

# Add push support
if [[ "$dry_run" == false ]]; then
    echo "Pushing changes..."
    git push origin $current_branch
fi
```

#### 2. Enhanced Conflict Resolution
Improves conflict handling to match sync's capabilities.

##### Description
- Automatic mergetool integration
- Separate merge and rebase conflict handling
- Clear progress indication
- State preservation during resolution

##### Implementation
```bash
handle_conflicts() {
    local conflict_type=$1  # merge or rebase
    
    echo "Conflicts detected during $conflict_type:"
    git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
    
    echo "Launching mergetool..."
    if ! git mergetool; then
        echo "Error: Failed to launch mergetool"
        return 1
    fi
    
    # Check remaining conflicts
    if [[ -n $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U) ]]; then
        echo "Some conflicts need manual resolution."
        echo "Please resolve conflicts and run 'update-branch --continue'"
        return 1
    fi
    
    if [[ "$conflict_type" == "merge" ]]; then
        git commit -m "Merge origin/$main_branch into $current_branch"
    fi
}
```

#### 3. Skip Main Option
Adds flexibility to skip main branch updates when only remote sync is needed.

##### Description
- Optional main branch update
- Preserves existing behavior by default
- Clear command-line option
- Status tracking

##### Implementation
```bash
# Add to argument parsing
while [[ "$#" -gt 0 ]]; do
    case $1 in
        --continue) continue_update=true ;;
        --dry-run) dry_run=true ;;
        --no-main) skip_main=true ;;  # New option
        *) echo "Unknown parameter: $1"; return 1 ;;
    esac
    shift
done
```

#### 4. Rebase Support
Adds proper rebase handling for diverged branches.

##### Description
- Handles branch divergence
- Preserves commit history
- Automatic conflict resolution
- Clear status messages

##### Implementation
```bash
handle_rebase_conflicts() {
    echo "Conflicts detected during rebase."
    handle_conflicts "rebase"
    
    if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
        git rebase --continue
    else
        echo "Please resolve conflicts and run 'git rebase --continue'"
        echo "Then run 'update-branch --continue'"
        return 1
    fi
}
```

#### 5. Enhanced Progress Tracking
Adds detailed progress tracking and status reporting.

##### Description
- Stage-by-stage tracking
- Persistent progress state
- Clear status display
- Error state tracking

##### Implementation
```bash
track_progress() {
    local stage=$1
    local status=$2
    
    echo "{\"stage\": \"$stage\", \"status\": \"$status\", \"timestamp\": \"$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")\"}" >> .git/UPDATE_PROGRESS
}

show_progress() {
    if [[ -f .git/UPDATE_PROGRESS ]]; then
        echo "Update progress:"
        cat .git/UPDATE_PROGRESS | jq -r '.stage + ": " + .status'
    fi
}
```

## Command Comparison After Improvements

### Alternative Approach: Adding --no-push to sync

Instead of adding all sync features to update-branch, we could add a --no-push option to sync to match update-branch's behavior:

```bash
# In sync_branch():
while [[ "$#" -gt 0 ]]; do
    case $1 in
        --continue) continue_sync=true ;;
        --no-main) skip_main=true ;;
        --no-push) skip_push=true ;;  # New option
        --dry-run) dry_run=true ;;
        *) echo "Unknown parameter: $1"; return 1 ;;
    esac
    shift
done

# Later in the push section:
if [[ "$skip_push" == true ]]; then
    echo "Skipping push (--no-push specified)"
else
    if [[ "$dry_run" == true ]]; then
        echo "[DRY-RUN] Would push changes"
    else
        echo "Pushing to origin..."
        if ! git push origin $current_branch; then
            echo "Error: Failed to push changes"
            return 1
        fi
    fi
fi
```

## Command Flags Analysis

### Current Flags

#### sync Command Flags
1. **--continue**
   - Purpose: Resume sync after resolving conflicts
   - When to use: After manually resolving conflicts
   - Example: `git sync --continue`

2. **--no-update**
   - Purpose: Skip updating from main branch
   - When to use: When you only want to sync with remote
   - Example: `git sync --no-update`

3. **--dry-run** (Proposed)
   - Purpose: Show what would happen without making changes
   - When to use: To preview the sync operation
   - Example: `git sync --dry-run`

4. **--no-push** (Proposed)
   - Purpose: Skip pushing changes to remote
   - When to use: When you want to update but not share changes
   - Example: `git sync --no-push`

#### Flag Naming Convention
Our flags follow a consistent pattern:
- `--no-<action>`: Skip a specific operation
  - --no-update: Skip main branch update
  - --no-push: Skip push to remote
- `--dry-run`: Preview mode
- `--continue`: Resume after interruption

### Flag Comparison

#### dry-run vs no-push
These flags serve different purposes:

1. **--dry-run**
   - Shows all operations that would happen
   - Makes no actual changes
   - Useful for safety checking
   ```bash
   $ git sync --dry-run
   [DRY-RUN] Would stash changes
   [DRY-RUN] Would update from production
   [DRY-RUN] Would pull latest changes
   [DRY-RUN] Would push to origin
   ```

2. **--no-push**
   - Performs all operations except the final push
   - Actually makes local changes
   - Useful when you want to update but review before sharing
   ```bash
   $ git sync --no-push
   Stashing local changes...
   Updating from production...
   Pulling latest changes...
   Skipping push (--no-push specified)
   Restoring local changes...
   ```

#### The Role of --no-update

The --no-update flag (previously --no-main) is valuable because:
1. Sometimes you only want to sync with your remote branch
2. Main branch updates might not always be needed
3. Helps with specific workflow patterns

Example scenarios:
```bash
# Full sync with main and remote
$ git sync
# Updates from main, syncs with remote, pushes changes

# Only sync with remote branch
$ git sync --no-update
# Skips main branch update, only syncs with remote

# Update from main but don't push
$ git sync --no-push
# Updates from main, syncs with remote, no push

# Preview everything
$ git sync --dry-run
# Shows what would happen without changes

# Only sync with remote and don't push
$ git sync --no-update --no-push
# Only pulls from remote, no main update, no push
```

### Recommended Flag Combinations

| Scenario | Command | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Full sync | `git sync` | Update from main, sync with remote, push changes |
| Safe update | `git sync --no-push` | Update from main and remote, no push |
| Remote only | `git sync --no-update` | Only sync with remote branch |
| Local preview | `git sync --dry-run` | Show what would happen |
| Remote sync preview | `git sync --no-update --dry-run` | Preview remote sync only |

### Implementation Considerations

When implementing these flags, we need to ensure:
1. Clear flag precedence (e.g., --dry-run overrides --no-push)
2. Logical combinations (all combinations should make sense)
3. Clear user feedback for each flag
4. Consistent behavior across commands

Example implementation:
```bash
# Flag handling in sync command
local dry_run=false
local skip_update=false  # Changed from skip_main
local skip_push=false

# Parse arguments
while [[ "$#" -gt 0 ]]; do
    case $1 in
        --continue) continue_sync=true ;;
        --no-update) skip_update=true ;;  # Changed from --no-main
        --no-push) skip_push=true ;;
        --dry-run) 
            dry_run=true
            # dry-run implies no-push for safety
            skip_push=true
            ;;
        *) echo "Unknown parameter: $1"; return 1 ;;
    esac
    shift
done

# Example operation with flags
if [[ "$dry_run" == true ]]; then
    echo "[DRY-RUN] Would perform operations..."
    return 0
fi

if [[ "$skip_update" == false ]]; then  # Changed from skip_main
    # Update from main branch
    echo "Updating from $main_branch..."
fi

# Always sync with remote
git fetch origin $current_branch

if [[ "$skip_push" == false ]]; then
    # Push changes
    echo "Pushing to remote..."
fi
```

This would make the commands equivalent:
```bash
# These would do the same thing:
$ update-branch
$ git sync --no-push

# And these:
$ update-branch && git push origin HEAD
$ git sync
```
