# ðŸ”„ Git Sync Command

The `git sync` command is a comprehensive solution for branch synchronization that combines updating from the main branch, syncing with remote, and sharing changes in a single command with flexible control through flags.

## Usage

```bash
git sync [options]
```

## Options

- `--continue`: Resume sync after conflict resolution
- `--no-update`: Skip updating from main branch
- `--no-pull`: Skip pulling from remote
- `--no-push`: Skip pushing to remote
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be done without making changes
- `-h`: Show help message

## Examples

1. Full sync (update from main, sync with remote, push):
   ```bash
   git sync
   ```

2. Update from main but don't push:
   ```bash
   git sync --no-push
   ```

3. Only sync with remote (skip main branch update):
   ```bash
   git sync --no-update
   ```

4. Preview changes without executing:
   ```bash
   git sync --dry-run
   ```

5. After resolving conflicts:
   ```bash
   git sync --continue
   ```

## Workflow

The sync command performs three operations in this order:
1. Update from main branch (get updates from main)
2. Pull from remote (get updates from your branch)
3. Push to remote (share your changes)

This order ensures:
- You first get main branch updates
- Then sync with your remote branch
- Finally share your changes

## Features

1. **Branch Management**
   - Updates from configured main branch
   - Syncs with remote branch
   - Handles stashing automatically
   - Preserves local changes

2. **Safety Features**
   - Dry-run mode for previewing changes
   - Flexible control with various flags
   - Automatic conflict detection

3. **Conflict Handling**
   - Automatic mergetool integration
   - Clear conflict status messages
   - Progress tracking
   - State preservation

4. **Mergetool Integration**
   - Automatically launches configured mergetool on conflicts
   - Uses mergetool settings from chronogit configuration
   - Supports custom mergetool paths and arguments

## Best Practices

1. Always run `git sync --dry-run` before actual sync to preview changes.
2. Resolve conflicts promptly when they occur.
3. Use `git sync --no-push` to review changes before sharing.
4. Regularly sync your branch to avoid large divergences.
5. Configure your preferred mergetool using `git chronogit` for seamless conflict resolution.

## Troubleshooting

- If sync fails due to conflicts, resolve them and use `git sync --continue`.
- If you encounter unexpected behavior, check the [known issues](../known-issues.md) document.
- For more detailed troubleshooting, refer to the [troubleshooting guide](../installation/troubleshooting.md).
- If you're having issues with the mergetool, ensure it's properly configured using `git chronogit`.
