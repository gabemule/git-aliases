## Common Patterns

All commands follow these consistent patterns:

### 1. Help Messages
```bash
# View command help
git start -h
git cc -h
git pr -h
git sync -h
git rollback -h
git jerrypick -h
git workspace -h

# Note: Using --help shows alias definition
# See known-issues.md for details
```

### 2. Ticket Handling
```bash
# Set with branch
git start-branch -t PROJ-123

# Override for commit
git cc -t PROJ-456

# Automatically included in PR
git open-pr  # Uses branch ticket
```

### 3. Interactive vs Non-interactive
```bash
# Interactive (prompts for input)
git cc

# Non-interactive (all flags)
git cc -m "message" --type feat -s ui
```

### 4. Short Aliases
```bash
git start     # for start-branch
git cc        # for conventional-commit
git pr        # for open-pr
git sync      # for branch synchronization
git rollback  # for rollback
git jerrypick # for cherry-pick
git workspace # for workspace management
git ssh-config # for SSH key and identity management
```

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Show test help
git test -h

# Run test suite
git test

# Select test type:
1) Interactive workflow tests
2) Non-interactive flag tests
3) Verification tests
4) All tests
5) Exit
```
