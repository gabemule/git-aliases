# Git Workflow Improvements

## Overview
This documentation describes planned improvements and new features for our git workflow system.

## Planned Improvements

### Review Process
- [Review Command](review-command.md) - Streamlined PR review process

### Workspace Management
- [Workspace Command](workspace-command.md) - Save and restore workspace states

### Progress Tracking
- [Standup Command](standup-command.md) - Generate work summaries for standups

### Mergetool Integration
- [Mergetool Integration](mergetool-integration.md) - Improved conflict resolution process

## Implementation Priority

1. High Priority
   - Review command
   - Mergetool integration

2. Medium Priority
   - Standup command

3. Nice to Have
   - Workspace command

## Next Steps

1. Implement high priority improvements:
   - Review command for streamlined PR process
   - Mergetool integration for better conflict resolution

2. Add comprehensive testing:
   - Unit tests for each new command
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Configuration tests

3. Update documentation:
   - Command usage guides
   - Configuration options
   - Best practices
   - Troubleshooting guides

4. Gather team feedback:
   - Initial command testing
   - Workflow integration
   - Feature requests
   - Bug reports

## Technical Roadmap

1. Command Structure
   - Standardize flag names (--no-<action>, --dry-run patterns)
   - Consistent error handling
   - Shared utility functions
   - Common configuration system

2. Safety Features
   - Dry run support for all commands
   - Backup mechanisms
   - Progress tracking
   - State recovery

3. User Experience
   - Better error messages
   - Interactive modes
   - Help documentation
   - Command aliases

4. Development Infrastructure
   - Logging system
   - Test framework
   - Version tracking
   - Release management

Note: Some previously planned improvements (sync, rollback, and cherry-pick commands) have been implemented and are now part of the main ChronoGit functionality. Refer to the main documentation for information on these commands.
