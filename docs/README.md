# Git Workflow Improvements

## Overview
This documentation describes improvements and new features for our git workflow system.

## Command Reference

### Branch Management
- [Branch Synchronization Analysis](branch-sync-comparison.md) - Comparison of update-branch and sync commands

### Production Management
- [Rollback Command](rollback-command.md) - Safe production rollback process with:
  - Interactive commit selection from configured main branch
  - Automatic rollback branch creation
  - Change verification and conflict detection
  - PR-based review process
  - Dry run support
  - Uses same main branch configuration as start-branch

### Review Process
- [Review Command](review-command.md) - Streamlined PR review process

### Workspace Management
- [Workspace Command](workspace-command.md) - Save and restore workspace states

### Progress Tracking
- [Standup Command](standup-command.md) - Generate work summaries for standups

## Implementation Priority

1. Critical Priority
   - Rollback command (production safety)
   - Branch synchronization (sync command)

2. High Priority
   - Review command

3. Medium Priority
   - Standup command

4. Nice to Have
   - Workspace command

## Next Steps

1. Implement critical commands:
   - Rollback command first (production safety)
   - Then sync command for daily workflow

2. Add comprehensive testing:
   - Unit tests for each command
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Specific tests for rollback scenarios
   - Configuration tests

3. Update documentation:
   - Command usage guides
   - Configuration options
   - Best practices
   - Troubleshooting guides

4. Gather team feedback:
   - Initial command testing
   - Workflow integration
   - Feature requests
   - Bug reports

## Technical Roadmap

1. Command Structure
   - Standardize flag names (--no-<action>, --dry-run patterns)
   - Consistent error handling
   - Shared utility functions
   - Common configuration system

2. Safety Features
   - Dry run support for all commands
   - Backup mechanisms
   - Progress tracking
   - State recovery

3. User Experience
   - Better error messages
   - Interactive modes
   - Help documentation
   - Command aliases

4. Development Infrastructure
   - Logging system
   - Test framework
   - Version tracking
   - Release management
